# VizualAge_UcomPbine

This is the new home of VizualAge_UcomPbine, a U-Pb geochronology data reduction scheme (DRS) add-on for iolite 2/3 (www.iolite-software.com) written as a set of Igor Pro procedures. This DRS is used for LA-ICP-MS U-Pb geochronology involving reference materials with variable common Pb.

# Requirements

1. Igor Pro 6.
2. Iolite 2.5 (i.e. freeware version) or 3+ (i.e. commercial version).
3. VizualAge (www.github.com/japetrus/VizualAge)

# Installation

1. Copy VizualAge_UcomPbine.ipf **or** VizualAge_UcomPbine_I2.ipf to iolite's "Data Reduction Schemes" folder, for iolite 3+ or 2.5, respectively.
3. Restart iolite.

# Known problems

1. Isn't happy with Igor Pro 7. Hoping to fix soon.
